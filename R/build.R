#' Builds binder
#'
#' This function kicks off the image build on Mybinder.org. Although it is not
#' entirely necessary to run this step, doing so will ensure that there is a
#' built image on binder ready to launch. Otherwise the first time (or if your
#' binder is infrequently used), the build can take a long time.
